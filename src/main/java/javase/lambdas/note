Lambdas makes instances of anonymous class easier to read and write.

what is the type of lambda exp?
    Functional Interface ex:
        Runnable, FileFilter, Comparator
        Having only abstract method.
        Methods from object class doesn't count. ex: equals()
        Can be annotated with @FunctionalInterface(compile time check)

can lambda assigned to a variable?
    Yes
    can be taken as method parameter and can be return by a method.
    this makes it more powerful.

is lambda exp is object?
    Instance of anonymous class is created by new keyword which involves overhead.

    JVM doesn't create object of lambda.

    exactly not an object, but it is registered as a object in JVM.
    It is a new kind of object, known as object without identity.
