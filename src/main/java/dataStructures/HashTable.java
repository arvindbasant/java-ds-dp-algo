/*
* HashTable:
*
* Offers very fast insertion and searching
*
* No matter how many data items there are, insertion and searching (and sometimes deletion)
* can take close to constant time: O(1) in big O notation.
*
* Relatively easy to program.
*
* Typically use hash tables when they need to look up tens of thousands of items in less than a second (as in spelling checkers).
*
* Disadvantages:
*
* They’re based on arrays, and arrays are difficult to expand after they’ve been created.
*
* Performance may degrade catastrophically when a table becomes too full, so the programmer needs to have a fairly accurate idea
* of how many data items will need to be stored.
*
* There’s no convenient way to visit the items in a hash table.
